# **REACT JOBS  APP**
Welcome to my React Jobs App. This showcases my skills
and experience in reect app development using React library. I have showcased  how to use React library works
and how to build a simple job listing app. The React components and  the useState have been the key features to 
me in the creation of this application. The incorparation of HTML, JavaScript and CSS have also been implemented
to make this application simpler and more flexible.
